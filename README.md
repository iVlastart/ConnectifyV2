This was my school project. The goal was to better understand PHP/SQL and learn Laravel by making a social media app.<br>
The frontend was made using HTML, Tailwind and JQuery. I used PHP for the backend and SQL (PhpMyAdmin) for database<br>
You can run this project via start.sh. PhpMyAdmin contains the database that should be imported to PhpMyAdmin.
