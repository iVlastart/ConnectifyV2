This was my school project. It is a web app made in Laravel. The goal was to better understand PHP and learn Laravel by making a social media app (something like Twitter).<br>
The frontend was made using HTML, Tailwind and JQuery. I used PHP for the backend and SQL (PhpMyAdmin) for database<br>
You can run this project via start.sh. PhpMyAdmin contains the database.
